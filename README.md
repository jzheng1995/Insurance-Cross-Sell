# Predicting Insurance Cross Sell

## Project description

Welcome to the Insurance Cross Sell Prediction project! This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a machine learning analysis aimed at predicting whether a customer will buy services from their existing insurance provider (i.e., cross sell). Accurately predicting cross sell is crucial for insurance business to improves sales and revenue.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can classify customers into two categories: those who will likely buy additional services and those who won't. By identifying these customers, businesses can implement targeted interventions to sell their services.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project belongs to the [Kaggle Playground Series](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7/overview). The data includes various features that might influence a customer's decision to buy more services, such as:

- Customer demographics (Age, gender, etc.)
- Customer information (Previously insured, vehicle age,  etc.)

## Methods

We evaluated the performance of the following models in predicting insurance cross sell using Python and the scikit-learn machine learning framework:

- Multiple classifiers and voting classifier
- TBD
- TBH

## Results

1. The naive voting classifier model achieved 87% accuracy in the public leaderboard.
